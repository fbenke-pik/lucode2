\usage{
checkRequiredPackages(
  requiredPackages,
  requiredFor = "",
  installFunction = install.packages,
  readlineFunction = readline,
  libPaths = .libPaths()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{requiredPackages}{One or more names of packages that are checked using requireNamespace.}

\item{requiredFor}{Optional single string. What the packages are required for, usually the name of a function.}

\item{installFunction}{Optional function, defaults to install.packages. Will be called during
checkRequiredPackages like this: installFunction(missingPackages, libPaths[[1]]). Only needed if the required
packages are not available on CRAN or the configured repos (getOption("repos")). In that case you might want to use
something like this: function(...) remotes::install_github("USDA-ERS/MTED-HARr").}

\item{readlineFunction}{This argument was added for testing. A function to get an answer from the user.}

\item{libPaths}{This argument was added for testing. Where to look for and install the required packages.}
}
\description{
Check if one or more packages are available and try to install the missing packages. Throw an error if at least one
of the required packages is still missing after the installation attempt.
